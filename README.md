# airbus_320_Data
This dataset contains operational data from Airbus A320 flights, specifically from the airline Air Arabia, aimed at analyzing and predicting fuel consumption patterns. It includes various parameters such as flight duration, distance, average speed, fuel used, fuel efficiency, and engine performance indicators.

The primary objective of this dataset is to enable the development of predictive models that help reduce fuel consumption and operational costs in aviation. With features suitable for regression, classification, and clustering tasks, the dataset supports various machine learning applications, such as:

Fuel consumption prediction using regression techniques.
Flight efficiency classification based on flight parameters and fuel data.
Clustering of flight profiles for operational optimization.
Anomaly detection in engine behavior or fuel efficiency.

This dataset is suitable for both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms and provides a valuable resource for aviation data analysts, ML practitioners, and fuel efficiency researchers. It supports the broader goal of applying Business Intelligence (BI) and AI-driven analytics to enhance decision-making in the aviation sector.
